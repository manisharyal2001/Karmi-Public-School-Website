## Notes

- This is a frontend demo project. In a production environment, you would need:
  - A backend server to handle API requests
  - Database integration for persistent data storage
  - Proper authentication and security measures
- Some features use localStorage for demo purposes which would be replaced with proper session management in a production environment
